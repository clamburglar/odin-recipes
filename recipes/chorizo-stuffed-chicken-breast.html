    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>    Spanish chorizo stuffed chicken breast is a prime example of my successful attempts in making boneless skinless chicken breast less boringâ€”one foolproof thing is stuffing it with sausage.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano (optional)</li>
        <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts (8 to 10 ounces each)</li>
        <li>2 ounces Spanish chorizo sausage, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fine breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sherry wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix olive oil, garlic, and oregano in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Use a sharp thin knife to make five deep slashes at a 45-degree angle into the chicken breast, about an inch apart, going almost, but not quite all the way through.  Leave about 1/2-inch of breast un-cut on either side of the slash.</li>
        <li>Salt chicken breasts generously on both sides, and spoon oil mixture on top. Rub olive oil mixture into slashes, and all over the surface and bottom of the breasts.</li>
        <li>Slide slices of chorizo into the slashes in the chicken. Once inserted, at least 75% of the sausage slice should be covered by chicken.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to an oven safe skillet or pan, and pour over any extra oil. Dust breasts with breadcrumbs, and sprinkle with cheese.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from pan, and let rest on plate, loosely covered with foil.</li>
        <li>Add vinegar and sherry to the pan and turn the heat to medium high. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until sauce has reduced by half.</li>
        <li>Add any accumulated juices from the plate of chicken to the pan. Reduce heat to lowest setting and stir in cold butter. Stir constantly until butter has disappeared.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, and stir in the parsley. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to plates and top with sauce.</li>
    </ol>
